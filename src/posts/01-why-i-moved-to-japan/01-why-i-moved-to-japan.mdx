## Why I Always Wanted To Visit

Last weekend I visited Tokyo, Japan and I immediately fell in love with the
city, it’s people and their culture. There is no other place in the world, I
would have wanted to visit. For those five days, it was like I was living a
dream. It’s a place that inspired my childhood. I didn’t grow up to Superman,
and Batman like my father. Saturday mornings I would wake up and watch the
latest Pokemon episode. 4 o’clock I would come back from elementary school and
watch Dragonball Z, and then play Playstation.

Just walking around the city for those five days seeing neighborhoods where my
favorite cartoon characters got their names from like Ryōgoku, Naruto, and
Sakura. It brought me back to those earlier days when the world was still new to
me. Days so long ago that it’s hard to remember.

I felt comfortable going across the city. For most of the days, I traveled
alone. Each day I would wake up and have a rough idea of what I wanted to do. I
didn’t want to plan too much because I wanted to go “wherever the wind took me”.
As a result, I got lost a few times, but it ended up being a good thing. I saw
parts of Tokyo that you wouldn’t find in a tourist brochure.

## Never Act Like A Tourist When Traveling

I walked through residential neighborhoods and saw everyday people doing
everyday things. Eventually, when I got back on track, I saw things like Statue
of Liberty, world famous neighborhoods, the Tokyo skyline, and so much more.

By the end of the day, I would rest in the hostel’s common area, and talk to
people all across the world. They might not have realized it, but their stories
inspired me. I met a brother and sister pair, 18 and 19 years old traveling the
world fresh out of high school. One guy said he worked for about 4 months, saved
a couple thousand dollars, and backpacked across Europe. Another guy traveled
all across Japan, and he makes coffee for a living.
