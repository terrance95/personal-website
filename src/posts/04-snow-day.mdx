Earlier this winter, a colleague of mine at Jetpack Group approached me with an
awesome idea on how we could improve one of our biggest education client’s
experience with our platform. Every winter, there are inevitable inclement
weather conditions in the Midwest that cause their schools to shut down. No
matter how much you check the weather the previous night, the final call is
always made the morning of. So the earliest the parents and children can be
informed, the better.

Our client is a large school network with nearly a dozen campuses; each with
their own campus website; in addition to the main website that is the primary
hub representing all the schools. Having to update this at 5 am in the morning,
as timely as possible, for the students and their families is a daunting task.

My colleague’s solution was to build a simple mobile app, where a school
administrator could roll out of bed, and with one-click update all of the
websites.

## Solution

Build a simple API that sits between the website and a React Native (iOS and
Android) app. The website listens to any changes in the API and the mobile app
updates it.

## Technical Overview

### API

For the speed of deployment, we decided to use LoopBack. With it’s CLI tool, we
had the API ready within a few minutes. We then connected to a cloud MongoDB for
the database source and added some authentication features to get a live RESTful
API ready to make some requests.

API ready to make some requests.

### React Native

Under the hood, the React Native primary completes two tasks. When
ComponentDidMount runs, it checks the status of the API, set state to the
retrieve value, and renders the appropriate view. Once rendered, the school
admin can press a button that sends a PATCH request to the API with a true or
false value, while updating the internal state between each toggle.

## UI/UX

While designing this single-purpose app, there were two primary considerations
we wanted to keep in mind: Feedback and Rewards. We wanted to give the school
admin enough visual cues to feel confident the app worked in updating the
website. Several cues were added to the app to give such feedback:

-   A status bar inside the card to confirm the state of the snow day.
-   A pulsing button to indicate when the state is active.
-   A snowfall animation for additional feedback and to reward the school admin
    for clicking.

## Final Thoughts

The app will be privately distributed to our school admin and we look forward to
hearing their feedback. We have a few ideas on the table on how to broaden the
scope of the project and add a few more useful features now that the initial
setup is complete. As for the parents and students, we hope we delivered a
faster way to alert them so they can better plan their day.
