Earlier this winter, a colleague of mine at Jetpack Group approached me with an
awesome idea on how we could improve one of our biggest education client’s
experience with our platform. Every winter, there are inevitable inclement
weather conditions in the Midwest that cause their schools to shut down. No
matter how much you check the weather the previous night, the final call is
always made the morning of. So the earliest the parents and children can be
informed, the better.

Our client is a large school network with nearly a dozen campuses; each with
their own campus website; in addition to the main website that is the primary
hub representing all the schools. Having to update this at 5 am in the morning,
as timely as possible, for the students and their families is a daunting task.

My colleague’s solution was to build a simple mobile app, where a school
administrator could roll out of bed, and with one-click update all of the
websites.
